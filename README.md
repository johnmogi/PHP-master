# PHP-master - one repo to rule them all...

in this master snippets project I'll be covering everything PHP + wordpress, from simple php wp functions and conventions to full blown OOP php server with mysql, custom hooks, basic plugins and wp themes - the real target is to arrive at laravel, twigs and core ajax rest api, react in wp graphql etc.

## order of appearence:
WORDPRESS - tutplus - covers the very basic.

if you survived this far- congrats- it's going to be awesome (:
